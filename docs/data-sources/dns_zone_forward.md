# nios_dns_zone_forward (Data Source)

Retrieves information about existing DNS Forward Zones.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Retrieve a specific DNS zone forward record by filters
data "nios_dns_zone_forward" "get_record_using_filters" {
  filters = {
    fqdn = "zone-forward1.example.com"
  }
}

// Retrieve specific DNS zone forward records using Extensible Attributes
data "nios_dns_zone_forward" "get_record_using_extensible_attributes" {
  extattrfilters = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Retrieve all DNS zone forward records in default view
data "nios_dns_zone_forward" "get_all_records_in_default_view" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `extattrfilters` (Map of String) External Attribute Filters are used to return a more specific list of results by filtering on external attributes. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Required:

- `fqdn` (String) The name of this DNS zone. For a reverse zone, this is in "address/cidr" format. For other zones, this is in FQDN format. This value can be in unicode format. Note that for a reverse zone, the corresponding zone_format value should be set.

Optional:

- `comment` (String) Comment for the zone; maximum 256 characters.
- `disable` (Boolean) Determines whether a zone is disabled or not. When this is set to False, the zone is enabled.
- `disable_ns_generation` (Boolean) Determines whether a auto-generation of NS records in parent zone is disabled or not. When this is set to False, the auto-generation is enabled.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.
- `external_ns_group` (String) A forward stub server name server group.
- `forward_to` (Attributes List) The information for the remote name servers to which you want the Infoblox appliance to forward queries for a specified domain name. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--forward_to))
- `forwarders_only` (Boolean) Determines if the appliance sends queries to forwarders only, and not to other internal or Internet root servers.
- `forwarding_servers` (Attributes List) The information for the Grid members to which you want the Infoblox appliance to forward queries for a specified domain name. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--forwarding_servers))
- `locked` (Boolean) If you enable this flag, other administrators cannot make conflicting changes. This is for administration purposes only. The zone will continue to serve DNS data even when it is locked.
- `ms_ad_integrated` (Boolean) The flag that determines whether Active Directory is integrated or not. This field is valid only when ms_managed is "STUB", "AUTH_PRIMARY", or "AUTH_BOTH".
- `ms_ddns_mode` (String) Determines whether an Active Directory-integrated zone with a Microsoft DNS server as primary allows dynamic updates. Valid values are: "SECURE" if the zone allows secure updates only. "NONE" if the zone forbids dynamic updates. "ANY" if the zone accepts both secure and nonsecure updates. This field is valid only if ms_managed is either "AUTH_PRIMARY" or "AUTH_BOTH". If the flag ms_ad_integrated is false, the value "SECURE" is not allowed.
- `ns_group` (String) A forwarding member name server group.
- `prefix` (String) The RFC2317 prefix value of this DNS zone. Use this field only when the netmask is greater than 24 bits; that is, for a mask between 25 and 31 bits. Enter a prefix, such as the name of the allocated address block. The prefix can be alphanumeric characters, such as 128/26 , 128-189 , or sub-B.
- `view` (String) The name of the DNS view in which the zone resides. Example "external".
- `zone_format` (String) Determines the format of this zone.

Read-Only:

- `address` (String) The IP address of the server that is serving this zone.
- `display_domain` (String) The displayed name of the DNS zone.
- `dns_fqdn` (String) The name of this DNS zone in punycode format. For a reverse zone, this is in "address/cidr" format. For other zones, this is in FQDN format in punycode format.
- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object , including default attributes.
- `locked_by` (String) The name of a superuser or the administrator who locked this zone.
- `mask_prefix` (String) IPv4 Netmask or IPv6 prefix for this zone.
- `ms_managed` (String) The flag that indicates whether the zone is assigned to a Microsoft DNS server. This flag returns the authoritative name server type of the Microsoft DNS server. Valid values are: "NONE" if the zone is not assigned to any Microsoft DNS server. "STUB" if the zone is assigned to a Microsoft DNS server as a stub zone. "AUTH_PRIMARY" if only the primary server of the zone is a Microsoft DNS server. "AUTH_SECONDARY" if only the secondary server of the zone is a Microsoft DNS server. "AUTH_BOTH" if both the primary and secondary servers of the zone are Microsoft DNS servers.
- `ms_read_only` (Boolean) Determines if a Grid member manages the zone served by a Microsoft DNS server in read-only mode. This flag is true when a Grid member manages the zone in read-only mode, false otherwise. When the zone has the ms_read_only flag set to True, no changes can be made to this zone.
- `ms_sync_master_name` (String) The name of MS synchronization master for this zone.
- `parent` (String) The parent zone of this zone. Note that when searching for reverse zones, the "in-addr.arpa" notation should be used.
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.
- `using_srg_associations` (Boolean) This is true if the zone is associated with a shared record group.
