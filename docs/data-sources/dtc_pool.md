# nios_dtc_pool (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
// Retrieve a specific DTC Pool by filters 
data "nios_dtc_pool" "get_record_using_filters" {
  filters = {
    name = "dtc_pool"
  }
}

// Retrieve specific DTC Pool using Extensible Attributes
data "nios_dtc_pool" "get_record_using_extensible_attributes" {
  extattrfilters = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
}

// Retrieve all DTC Pools
data "nios_dtc_pool" "get_all_pools" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `extattrfilters` (Map of String) External Attribute Filters are used to return a more specific list of results by filtering on external attributes. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `filters` (Map of String) Filter are used to return a more specific list of results. Filters can be used to match resources by specific attributes, e.g. name. If you specify multiple filters, the results returned will have only resources that match all the specified filters.
- `max_results` (Number) Maximum number of objects to be returned. Defaults to 1000.
- `paging` (Number) Enable (1) or disable (0) paging for the data source query. When enabled, the system retrieves results in pages, allowing efficient handling of large result sets. Paging is enabled by default.

### Read-Only

- `result` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result))

<a id="nestedatt--result"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result`

Required:

- `lb_preferred_method` (String) The preferred load balancing method. Use this to select a method type from the pool.
- `name` (String) The DTC Pool display name.

Optional:

- `auto_consolidated_monitors` (Boolean) Flag for enabling auto managing DTC Consolidated Monitors in DTC Pool.
- `availability` (String) A resource in the pool is available if ANY, at least QUORUM, or ALL monitors for the pool say that it is up.
- `comment` (String) The comment for the DTC Pool; maximum 256 characters.
- `consolidated_monitors` (Attributes List) List of monitors and associated members statuses of which are shared across members and consolidated in server availability determination. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--consolidated_monitors))
- `disable` (Boolean) Determines whether the DTC Pool is disabled or not. When this is set to False, the fixed address is enabled.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.
- `lb_alternate_method` (String) The alternate load balancing method. Use this to select a method type from the pool if the preferred method does not return any results.
- `lb_alternate_topology` (String) The alternate topology for load balancing.
- `lb_dynamic_ratio_alternate` (Attributes) The DTC Pool settings for dynamic ratio when its selected as alternate method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--lb_dynamic_ratio_alternate))
- `lb_dynamic_ratio_preferred` (Attributes) The DTC Pool settings for dynamic ratio when its selected as preferred method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--lb_dynamic_ratio_preferred))
- `lb_preferred_topology` (String) The preferred topology for load balancing.
- `monitors` (List of String) The monitors related to pool.
- `quorum` (Number) For availability mode QUORUM, at least this many monitors must report the resource as up for it to be available
- `servers` (Attributes List) The servers related to the pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--servers))
- `ttl` (Number) The Time To Live (TTL) value for the DTC Pool. A 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the duration, in seconds, for which the record is valid (cached). Zero indicates that the record should not be cached.
- `use_ttl` (Boolean) Flag to indicate whether the TTL value should be used for the DTC Pool.

Read-Only:

- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object , including default attributes.
- `health` (Attributes) The health status of DTC Pool (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--result--health))
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.

### Nested Schema for `result.consolidated_monitors`

Optional:

- `availability` (String) Servers assigned to a pool with monitor defined are healthy if ANY or ALL members report healthy status.
- `full_health_communication` (Boolean) Flag for switching health performing and sharing behavior to perform health checks on each DTC grid member that serves related LBDN(s) and send them across all DTC grid members from both selected and non-selected lists.
- `members` (List of String) Members whose monitor statuses are shared across other members in a pool.
- `monitor` (String) Monitor whose statuses are shared across other members in a pool.


<a id="nestedatt--result--lb_dynamic_ratio_alternate"></a>
### Nested Schema for `result.lb_dynamic_ratio_alternate`

Optional:

- `invert_monitor_metric` (Boolean) Determines whether the inverted values of the DTC SNMP monitor metric will be used.
- `method` (String) The method of the DTC dynamic ratio load balancing.
- `monitor` (String) The DTC monitor output of which will be used for dynamic ratio load balancing.
- `monitor_metric` (String) The metric of the DTC SNMP monitor that will be used for dynamic weighing.
- `monitor_weighing` (String) The DTC monitor weight. 'PRIORITY' means that all clients will be forwarded to the least loaded server. 'RATIO' means that distribution will be calculated based on dynamic weights.
