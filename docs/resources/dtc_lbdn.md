# nios_dtc_lbdn (Resource)

Manages DTC Load Balanced Domain Name (LBDN)

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create DTC LBDN with basic fields
resource "nios_dtc_lbdn" "lbdn_basic_fields" {
  name      = "example_lbdn_1"
  lb_method = "SOURCE_IP_HASH"
}

// Create DTC LBDN with additional fields
resource "nios_dtc_lbdn" "lbdn_additional_fields" {
  name = "example_lbdn_2"
  // TODO: Retrieve references based on the provided names of the objects: auth_zones, pools, and topology
  auth_zones = ["zone_auth/ZG5zLnpvbmUkLl9kZWZhdWx0LmNvbS5yZWNvcmRfdGVzdA:wapi.com/default",
    "zone_auth/ZG5zLnpvbmUkLjEuY29tLnRlc3Q:info.com/default.custom_view"
  ]
  comment = "lbdn with additional parameters"
  extattrs = {
    Site = "location-1"
  }
  lb_method = "TOPOLOGY"
  patterns  = ["*wapi.com", "info.com*"]
  pools = [
    {
      pool  = "dtc:pool/ZG5zLmlkbnNfcG9vbCRwb29sMg:pool2"
      ratio = 2
    },
    {
      pool  = "dtc:pool/ZG5zLmlkbnNfcG9vbCRwb29sNA:pool4"
      ratio = 3
    },
    {
      pool  = "dtc:pool/ZG5zLmlkbnNfcG9vbCR0ZXN0LXBvb2w:pool6"
      ratio = 6
    }
  ]
  ttl         = 0
  use_ttl     = false
  topology    = "dtc:topology/ZG5zLmlkbnNfdG9wb2xvZ3kkdG9wbzE:topo1"
  disable     = true
  types       = ["A", "CNAME"]
  persistence = 100
  priority    = 1
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `lb_method` (String) The load balancing method. Used to select pool.
- `name` (String) The display name of the DTC LBDN, not DNS related.

### Optional

- `auth_zones` (List of String) List of linked auth zones.
- `auto_consolidated_monitors` (Boolean) Flag for enabling auto managing DTC Consolidated Monitors on related DTC Pools.
- `comment` (String) Comment for the DTC LBDN; maximum 256 characters.
- `disable` (Boolean) Determines whether the DTC LBDN is disabled or not. When this is set to False, the fixed address is enabled.
- `extattrs` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object.
- `patterns` (List of String) LBDN wildcards for pattern match.
- `persistence` (Number) Maximum time, in seconds, for which client specific LBDN responses will be cached. Zero specifies no caching.
- `pools` (Attributes List) The maximum time, in seconds, for which client specific LBDN responses will be cached. Zero specifies no caching. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pools))
- `priority` (Number) The LBDN pattern match priority for "overlapping" DTC LBDN objects. LBDNs are "overlapping" if they are simultaneously assigned to a zone and have patterns that can match the same FQDN. The matching LBDN with highest priority (lowest ordinal) will be used.
- `topology` (String) The topology rules for TOPOLOGY method.
- `ttl` (Number) Time-to-live value of the record, in seconds.
- `types` (List of String) The list of resource record types supported by LBDN.
- `use_ttl` (Boolean) Flag to indicate whether the TTL value should be used for the LBDN record.

### Read-Only

- `extattrs_all` (Map of String) Extensible attributes associated with the object , including default attributes.
- `health` (Attributes) The LBDN health information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--health))
- `ref` (String) The reference to the object.

<a id="nestedatt--pools"></a>
### Nested Schema for `pools`

Optional:

- `pool` (String) The pool to link with.
- `ratio` (Number) The weight of pool.


<a id="nestedatt--health"></a>
### Nested Schema for `health`

Read-Only:

- `availability` (String) The availability color status.
- `description` (String) The textual description of the object's status.
- `enabled_state` (String) The enabled state of the object.
